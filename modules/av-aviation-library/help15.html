<H1>AV-15 â€” Area Navigation - Load Module</H1>

<P>The area Navigation package consists of three programs: Area Nav
  Load Module (AV-15); VOR Area Nav (AV-16); and DME Area Nav
  (AV-14). The Load Module program is used to load position
  information into your calculator's data register for use in the VOR
  or DME Area Nav programs. The Load Module can handle numerous
  waypoints which may be VOR's or other geographic fixes, and can 1)
  Load the data registers directly, or 2) store the information on a
  blank Flight Data card. These Flight Data cards are particularly
  useful in that several may be recorded for a large area, and simply
  reading one will load the data registers with the information
  necessary to navigate in that section of the area.
</P>

<P>The VOR or DME Are Nav programs do the real work for the set. While
  similar, the choice between them is based on the type of equipment
  you have. Both use the same input data, and both programs compute
  distance to go, magnetic course, GS, and ETA to a specified
  waypoint.
</P>

<h2>Area Nav Load Module</h2>

<P>The programs are based on prestored geographical positions
  (referred to as 'waypoints') which may be navigational aids (VOR,
  ADF Radio Beacon, etc.), fixes (intersections, landmarks, obstacles,
  etc.), or other geographical locations (airports, towns, etc...)
  that may be located relative to each other. Each waypoint is stored
  so that it may be referred to by a number designation (0, 1, 2, ...,
  N*). The radials supplied by on-board VOR receivers give the pilot a
  means of accurately locating his aircraft in relation to those
  points, and by extension, in relation to other waypoints.
</P>

<P>The general method is based on selection of an arbitrary point
  (waypoint "0" with coordinates (0,0)) as the origin of a network of
  other defined waypoints (numbered 1-N). These waypoints are defined
  by their magnetic bearing and distance from either waypoint 0 or any
  previously defined waypoint (see Remark 1).
</P>

<P>To use the Load Module, select suitable charts which cover the area
  of interest and choose the navigational aids you wish to store as
  waypoints. At least two of these must be VOR stations. (Actually,
  one or both could be radio beacons if ADF reading were used and
  converted to <i>magnetic bearing from the station</i>.) It is
  desirable to define waypoints for departure, destination and
  alternate airports. Select a waypoint near the center of the area to
  be identified as "0", and others to be assigned number 1 - N as
  desired. Select the Load Module  program (AV-15) and load the
  network as follows:
</p>

<DL class="deflist">
  <DT>Enter number of waypoint to be loaded
    <DD>Press <SPAN CLASS="brownbutton">A</SPAN> (Load FIX)
  </DT>
  <DT>Enter number of waypoint used as a reference
    <DD>Press <SPAN CLASS="brownbutton">B</SPAN> (from FIX)
  </DT>
  <DT>Enter magnetic bearing from reference to new waypoint
    <DD>Press <SPAN CLASS="brownbutton">C</SPAN> (RAD)
  </DT>
  <DT>Enter distance between waypoints
    <DD>Press <SPAN CLASS="brownbutton">D</SPAN> (Dist)
  </DT>
</DL>

</P>Repeat for each waypoint. Note that the reference point for each
new fix must already have been defined to the calculator. Fix 0 is
always assumed as (0, 0), thus is <i>must</i> be the reference for the
first waypoint entered. The second waypoint entered may reference
either fix 0 or the first point entered, etc... The location of any
waypoint may be changed at any time before recording the data on
magnetic cards. However, movement of the origin required redefining
all other positions.
</P>

<P>If the network is one you might use frequently, it may then be
  stored on a blank magnetic card, creating a Flight Data card. This
  data card may then be read into memory at any time without even
  having to select the Load Module program.
</P>

<P>By recording several Flight Data cards, "blocks" of waypoints may
  be used to describe a long route. A new block would then be loaded
  as the aircraft left the previous one. At least one VOR should be
  common to adjacent blocks.
</P>

<P>Recording a network on a blank card does not affect the data
  registers (which will still be used). Thus, whether or not a Flight
  Data card is recorded, you may continue by immediately selecting the
  required navigation program.
</P>

<P>If a waypoint needs to be "moved" while navigating, the Load Module
  may be reselected for that purpose. Then, once the data has been
  changed you may reselect the appropriate navigation program and
  continue normally.
</P>

<h2>To Use Flight Data Card</h2>

<P>If you have entered your flight data and recorded it on a magnetic
  card or cards you may simply read this data into your calculator's
  data memory when it is needed for the VOR or DME Area Nav
  program. To do this simple
  press <SPAN CLASS="brownbutton">CLR</SPAN> and feed the
  card into the card slot. Once the card is read the number in the
  display indicates which bank was read.
</P>
<P><i>Note that on this emulator there is a single virtual card
  simulated, to read it
    just <SPAN CLASS="brownbutton">INV</SPAN>
