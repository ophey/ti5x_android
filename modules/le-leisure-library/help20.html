<H1>LE-20 — Sea Battle</H1>

<P>Because of battle damage, your missile frigate has no radar and no engine. A nuclear submarine
  whose last reported position was about 15,000 yards at an unknown bearing was coming toward you
  at 30 knots. You are armed with 15 small missiles which require 1 minute to manually insert the
  estimated range in yards and bearing in degrees. Previous intelligence reports show the following
  expectations versus missile-miss distance with this class of sub.
</P>

<TABLE>
  <TR><TH>Miss Distance (yds)<TH>Intelligence Report
  <TR><TD>Over 500<TD>No damage to sub. Sub comes straight at you after a miss of the distance.
  <TR><TD>500 and under
    <TD><UL>
        <LI>Sub suffers damage which decreases speed 6 knots per close hit until speed has decreased
          to 6 knots. No further decrease.
        <LI>Sub takes evasive action making 45° turn away from missile impact area.
        <LI>Repeated close hits cause the sub to continue on this 45° line if the miss is in the same
          direction or to veer 90° if the next miss is on the opposite side of the sub.
        <LI>A miss distance greater than 500 yards after a near miss causes the sub to come straight
          at you again.
      </UL>
  <TR><TD>50 and under<TD>Sinks sub.
</TABLE>

<P>You frigate will be sunk if you have fired all missiles without sinking the sub or if the sub comes
  within 500 yards of your frigate.

<UL>
  <LI>Initialize program :
    <SPAN CLASS="brownbutton">SBR</SPAN> <SPAN CLASS="yellowbutton">CLR</SPAN>. Displayed
    value will not be changed.

  <LI>To start the game press <SPAN CLASS="yellowbutton">2nd</SPAN>
    <SPAN CLASS="alttext">E'</SPAN>. The display will show 15000.15
    which indicates a range of 15000 yards and 15 missiles remaining.

  <LI>Key in estimated range in yards and press <SPAN CLASS="brownbutton">A</SPAN>. Remember the 1 minute
    interval between the range report and the missile firing. The sub will move during this time.

  <LI>Key in the estimated bearing in degrees (0 to 360°, positive or negative) and press
    <SPAN CLASS="brownbutton">B</SPAN>. Remember to account for movement of the sub since the last
    report.

  <LI>Range and bearing can be entered in either order. Changes can be made after entry if made
    before firing. You may elect not to fire a missile by keying 0, pressing
    <SPAN CLASS="brownbutton">A</SPAN> and then <SPAN CLASS="brownbutton">E</SPAN>. This preserves your
    missile supply but brings the sub closer.

  <LI>Press <SPAN CLASS="brownbutton">E</SPAN> to fire a missile at range and bearing selected. Display
    depends on miss distance. Sub takes action as noted in the intelligence Report. Display will be of
    following types:

    <TABLE>
      <TR><TH>Display<TH>Miss Distance<TH>Remarks
      <TR><TD>0.NN<TD>Over 5000<TD>No range information, only number of missiles lefts.
      <TR><TD>XXXX.NN<TD>5000 and under<TD>Missile transmits miss distance, sub comes straight at you.
      <TR><TD>XXX.NN<TD>500 and under<TD>See Intelligence Report for sub's action.
      <TR><TD>XX.NN (flashing)<TD>50 and under<TD>Sub has been sunk. Last missile number is preserved.
      <TR><TD>XXX.NN (flashing)<TD><TD>Sub came within 500 yards. You have been sunk.
      <TR><TD>XXX.00 (flashing)<TD><TD>All missiles have been fired. In case you sink sub with last missile, the calculator will preserve the missile number to avoid confusion.
    </TABLE>

  <LI>For a new game, start over above. Each game after the first does not necessary start with 15,000
    yards (but it will be within 500 yards of this) and will appear from a new bearing angle.
