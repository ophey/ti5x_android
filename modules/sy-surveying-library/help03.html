<H1>SY-03 — Inverse Traverse</H1>

<P>SY-02, SY-03, SY-04 and SY-05 form a group and are to be used together.

<P>This four programs calculate the unknown elements of a traverse
  leg, as well as total horizontal distance for use in closure
  determination, and intermediate calculations for an overall
  closed-traverse area. Each program deals with a certain type of
  traverse, but the programs may be used interdependently as
  demonstrated in the example, as well as in conjunction with the
  Closure and Balance programs.
</P>

<P>The key to interdependent use of these programs is the
  <SPAN CLASS="brownbutton">E</SPAN> keystroke. Basically,
  this arranges the data present in the storage registers for use in
  calculating the next leg of a traverse. While only the total
  horizontal distance is displayed following
  <SPAN CLASS="brownbutton">E</SPAN>, several other things
  also happen that re quite difficult to correct once
  completed. Therefore, be certain that all data for that leg is
  correct before pressing <SPAN CLASS="brownbutton">E</SPAN>.
</P>

<P>For the first leg, select the proper program (usually
  Azimuth/Bearing or Field Angle), initialize, and enter the reference
  data. This should be the <i>only</i> time you need to enter this
  data. The <SPAN CLASS="brownbutton">E</SPAN> command
  will do it otherwise. Once the (closed) traverse is complete, it is
  best to do to the Closure program, although Inverse Traverse will
  also work for closure. Then the Balance programs will distribute
  closure error in proportion to the leg length.
</P>

<P>In the first three programs, if an error occurs
  before <SPAN CLASS="brownbutton">E</SPAN>, it may be
  corrected by doing that leg again; but the Circle Arc program is
  somewhat different.
</P>

<P>Azimuth, Bearing and Quadrant (see SY-02).

<P>In SY-03, given the start and end coordinates of a traverse leg,
  this program calculates the latitude, departure, azimuth, bearing
  and quadrant, and horizontal distance of the leg. This has several
  uses:
</p>

<UL>
  <LI>Calculating closure bearing and distance
  <LI>Calculating corrected results from the adjusted coordinates
    output by the Balance programs
  <LI>Finding omitted measurements, etc...
</UL>

<P>Like the other traverse programs, the keystroke
  <SPAN CLASS="brownbutton">E</SPAN> instructs the
  calculator to occupy the next station, preserving continuity through
  the traverse. If this program is used for closure, then the total
  area bounded by the traverse is calculated.
</P>

<UL>
  <LI>Select degree mode,, press
    <SPAN CLASS="yellowbutton">2nd</SPAN>
    <SPAN CLASS="alttext">Deg</SPAN>
  <LI>Initialize, press
    <SPAN CLASS="yellowbutton">2nd</SPAN>
    <SPAN CLASS="alttext">E'</SPAN>

  <LI>Enter Reference North, press
    <SPAN CLASS="yellowbutton">2nd</SPAN>
    <SPAN CLASS="alttext">A'</SPAN>
  <LI>Enter Reference East, press
    <SPAN CLASS="brownbutton">R/S</SPAN>

  <LI>Enter next North, compute Lt, press
    <SPAN CLASS="brownbutton">A</SPAN>
  <LI>Enter next East, compute Dp, press
    <SPAN CLASS="brownbutton">B</SPAN>

  <LI>Compute horizontal distance, press
    <SPAN CLASS="brownbutton">C</SPAN>

  <LI>Compute bearing, press
    <SPAN CLASS="brownbutton">D</SPAN>

  <LI>Compute quadrant, press
    <SPAN CLASS="brownbutton">R/S</SPAN>
  <LI>Compute azimuth, press
    <SPAN CLASS="brownbutton">R/S</SPAN>

  <LI>Occupy next station and compute total Hz Dist thus far, press
    <SPAN CLASS="brownbutton">E</SPAN>

  <LI>For another station, restart to Enter next North above.

  <LI>Compute traverse area (only if program used for closure), do
    <SPAN CLASS="brownbutton">RLC</SPAN>
    <SPAN CLASS="whitebutton">1</SPAN>
    <SPAN CLASS="whitebutton">7</SPAN>
    <SPAN CLASS="yellowbutton">+</SPAN>
    <SPAN CLASS="brownbutton">(</SPAN>
    <SPAN CLASS="brownbutton">RLC</SPAN>
    <SPAN CLASS="whitebutton">1</SPAN>
    <SPAN CLASS="whitebutton">0</SPAN>
    <SPAN CLASS="yellowbutton">÷</SPAN>
    <SPAN CLASS="whitebutton">2</SPAN>
    <SPAN CLASS="yellowbutton">=</SPAN>

<P>Registers used: 00-05, 07-20.
