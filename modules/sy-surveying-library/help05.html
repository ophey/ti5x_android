<H1>SY-05 â€” Circle Arc Traverse</H1>

<P>SY-02, SY-03, SY-04 and SY-05 form a group and are to be used together.

<P>This four programs calculate the unknown elements of a traverse
  leg, as well as total horizontal distance for use in closure
  determination, and intermediate calculations for an overall
  closed-traverse area. Each program deals with a certain type of
  traverse, but the programs may be used interdependently as
  demonstrated in the example, as well as in conjunction with the
  Closure and Balance programs.
</P>

<P>The key to interdependent use of these programs is the
  <SPAN CLASS="brownbutton">E</SPAN> keystroke. Basically,
  this arranges the data present in the storage registers for use in
  calculating the next leg of a traverse. While only the total
  horizontal distance is displayed following
  <SPAN CLASS="brownbutton">E</SPAN>, several other things
  also happen that re quite difficult to correct once
  completed. Therefore, be certain that all data for that leg is
  correct before pressing <SPAN CLASS="brownbutton">E</SPAN>.
</P>

<P>For the first leg, select the proper program (usually
  Azimuth/Bearing or Field Angle), initialize, and enter the reference
  data. This should be the <i>only</i> time you need to enter this
  data. The <SPAN CLASS="brownbutton">E</SPAN> command
  will do it otherwise. Once the (closed) traverse is complete, it is
  best to do to the Closure program, although Inverse Traverse will
  also work for closure. Then the Balance programs will distribute
  closure error in proportion to the leg length.
</P>

<P>In the first three programs, if an error occurs
  before <SPAN CLASS="brownbutton">E</SPAN>, it may be
  corrected by doing that leg again; but the Circle Arc program is
  somewhat different.
</P>

<P>Azimuth, Bearing and Quadrant (see SY-02).

<P>This program (SY-05) must be preceded by either the
  Azimuth/Bearing, Inverse, or Field Angle Traverse program to
  establish the center coordinates, radius, and reference azimuth (of
  the known radial) of the arc. Then, given the central angle, this
  program calculates the azimuth, bearing and quadrant, latitude,
  departure, and end coordinates of the unknown radial. In addition,
  the arc distance is calculated and summed into the total distance
  register, while the previously calculated and summed leg distance is
  subtracted from that register, thus bounding the traverse by the arc
  rather than its radials.
</P>

<P>Note that the program assumes that the <i>closed traverse is
    bounded by the arc</i>. Two cases become apparent here:
</P>

<UL>
  <LI>In <b>Case 1</b>, the sector area must be included in the traverse,
  since the program otherwise calculates only the area inside the
    irregular polygon (bounded by the radials).

  <LI>In <b>Case 2</b>, the sector area will already be included, so
  the program must be instructed to subtract (exclude)
    A<sub>sect</sub>.

</UL>

<UL>
  <LI>Select degree mode,, press
    <SPAN CLASS="yellowbutton">2nd</SPAN>
    <SPAN CLASS="alttext">Deg</SPAN>

  <LI>Enter central angle (DDD.MMSS), press
    <SPAN CLASS="brownbutton">A</SPAN>

  <LI>Either:
    <UL>
      <LI>If C angle measured clockwise, press
        <SPAN CLASS="brownbutton">B</SPAN>
      <LI>If C angle measured counterclockwise, press
        <SPAN CLASS="yellowbutton">2nd</SPAN>
        <SPAN CLASS="alttext">B'</SPAN>
    </UL>

  <LI>Compute bearing, press
    <SPAN CLASS="brownbutton">R/S</SPAN>
  <LI>Compute quadrant, press
    <SPAN CLASS="brownbutton">R/S</SPAN>
  <LI>Compute arc distance, press
    <SPAN CLASS="brownbutton">C</SPAN>

  <LI>Either:
    <UL>
      <LI>Compute and <i>include</i> sector area, press
        <SPAN CLASS="yellowbutton">2nd</SPAN>
        <SPAN CLASS="alttext">C'</SPAN>
      <LI>Compute and <i>exclude</i> sector area, press
        <SPAN CLASS="yellowbutton">2nd</SPAN>
        <SPAN CLASS="alttext">D'</SPAN>
    </UL>

  <LI>Compute Departure, press
    <SPAN CLASS="brownbutton">D</SPAN>
  <LI>Compute Latitude, press
    <SPAN CLASS="brownbutton">R/S</SPAN>
  <LI>Compute next North, press
    <SPAN CLASS="brownbutton">R/S</SPAN>
  <LI>Compute next East, press
    <SPAN CLASS="brownbutton">R/S</SPAN>

  <LI>Occupy next station and compute total distance thus far, press
    <SPAN CLASS="brownbutton">E</SPAN>
</UL>
