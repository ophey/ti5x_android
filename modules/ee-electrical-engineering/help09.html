<H1>EE-9 â€” Roots of Polynomials</H1>

<P>The general form of a polynomial of degree n is P<sub>n</sub>(x) =
  a<sub>1</sub>x<sup>n</sup> + a<sub>2</sub>x<sup>n-1</sup> + ... +
  a<sub>n</sub>x + a<sub>n+1</sub>. This programs uses the
  Lin-Bairstow method to find all roots, real and complex, of up to
  21st degree polynomial in one variable with real coefficients.
</P>
<P>This method is based on the fact that the polynomial can be
  represented as a product of quadratic and linear factors. An initial
  guess is made of a trial quadratic factor which, for purposes of
  convergence, is hopefully near the desired factor of the
  polynomial. The trial factor is divided into the polynomial and a
  remainder factor is transformed into an "exact" factor of the
  polynomial by an iterative process which modifies the coefficients
  of the quadratic term to make the remainder less than or equal to
  &epsilon; (error factor).
</P>
<P>The resulting roots can be found by using the quadratic
formula. The original polynomial can now be reduced by dividing out
the quadratic factor. The remaining roots of the reduced polynomial
are computed in the same manner as above, with the program using the
exact quadratic factor which was just found as the new guess or
allowing the user the option of entering a quadratic factor for the
new guess. If, in the course of finding the root pairs by dividing out
the quadratic factors, the reduced polynomial has degree = 2, the
remaining roots are found using the quadratic formula; if degree = 1,
the obvious root is computed.
</P>

<H3>General notes regarding program operation</h3>

<OL>
  <LI>An initial estimate of u = v = 0 is recommended in searching for
    all roots. In general, there is no advantage in using previously
    computed values of u and v.

  <LI>A plot of f(x) may be used to find the approximate location
    of <b>real</b> roots. Then, Master Library program ML-08 may be used
    to find the exact location (within &epsilon;) of real roots. The
    order of f(x) may then be lowered by dividing f(x) by factors of the
    form (x - R<sub>i</sub>) where R<sub>i</sub> are the real roots.

  <LI>If f(x) has <b>multiple sets</b> of <b>equals</b> roots,
    &Delta;u and &Delta;v will appear to be converging but then may
    never get smaller than the stated &epsilon;. The solution to this
    pathological case is to define a larger &epsilon; and thus accept
    a less precise approximation of the equal roots.

  <LI>Do not assume divergence of &Delta;u, &Delta;v simply because
  monotonic convergence does not occur. &Delta;u and &Delta;v will
  often oscillate with large amplitude prior to convergence.
