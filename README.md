# TI59 Emulator

ti5x is an emulator, running on Android, for the venerable
TI-58/58C/59 family of programmable scientific calculators
which were manufactured by Texas Instruments from the late
1970s.

ti5x does aim for 100% authenticity even if not possible
in all cases. Yet, it supports many undocumented features
from the original calculator like the HIR registers and
the /DSZ nn 51/ (decrement no-jump) instructions.

With the current version it is possible to play the famous
Treasure-Island and 3D-Tic-Tac-Toe games.

## Location of programs:

The saved programs where stored into the Programs directory at
the root of the file system. Since Android-10 it is not possible
anymore to access this location for security reasons.

The programs are now saved into

  Android/Data/net.obry.ti5x/files/Programs

You need to manually move the programs from Programs/*.ti5p to
Android/Data/net.obry.ti5x/files/Programs to get access to them
with version 7.9.
